Base checklist 📝 for exploiting Tomcat servers:
- Detect:
   → Wappalyzer
   → Nuclei
   → Server error - use this to get the version!
   → Response headers
- Test common ports: 8080, 9080, 9443, 9005, 9009, 8082, 8180
- Try clicking on buttons - this is simply stupid but sometimes works!
- Detect manager endpoints - either try to find wordlists from GitHub or build your own using chatGPT.
- Try default credentials - admin:admin, tomcat:tomcat, admin: , admin:s3cr3t, tomcat:s3cr3t, admin:tomcat
- If you got in, DO NOT EXPLOIT FURTHER! No need to upload reverse shell .jsp as PoC!
